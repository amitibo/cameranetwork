# Image pipeline of *cameranetwork* 
This document describes the operations that are being done on images, 
and prepares the inputs required to run 3D reconstructions. 

## Prepossessing on board:
1. [Image capturing]('CameraNetwork/controller.py#L1578-1649'): multi shot averaging (for SNR enhancement), 
and for several exposure times (for HDR).
2. [Camera prepossessing]('CameraNetwork/controller.py#L1388-1527'): dark image subtraction, normalization (according to fisheye model), 
HDR calculation, and vignetting correction. 
    >Note: This function is called from [seekImageArray()]('CameraNetwork/controller.py#1272), and  [handle_array()]('CameraNetwork/controller.py#1221), 
that means that the saved images are before prepossessing, and one needs to call one of these in order to apply the prepossessing. 

## Prepossessing using GUI:
### 1. Masking & Space carving:
1. 2D *grabcut*: 
    
    - Choose under `Arrays` tab: `view settings` -> `space carving`. 

    - It creates a cloud mask based on dilation operation (Applied by a maximum filter). 

    - This operation is done in [ArrayModel._update_cloud_weights()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/f26cdd785dabfc6f8d217a0e9b16fa1870d26fa9/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L954)
2. 2D *sunshader*: 

    - choose under `Arrays` tab: `view settings` -> `sun shader`.   
    
    - It creates a sunshader mask based on *erosion* operation Since the mask is an inversion of the sunshader.) 

    - This is done in  [calcSunshaderMask()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/945e9e8519216d2bd8a75afa6e650367d8f7ee88/CameraNetwork/image_utils.py#L544).

3. 2D *ROI*:  

    - Choose under `Arrays` tab: `view settings` -> `Widgets` -> `show ROI`. 
    
    - This is a rectangular mask that determines what is the relevant area in the image that observes on the volume of interest. 
Currently, it is manually set. 

    - Choosing the option `Show Grid` presents the inspected volume (on the map shown as a blue cube) and it's voxel as grid projection 
(red scatter plot on each of the images), thus helps to set the ROI. 

    - The ROI can be uploaded from earlier sessions or saved (as .pkl file). 

4. 2D and 3D space carving: 
    - This operation is done in [Map3dModel.do_space_carving()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/19efb5bbf0350d6cbd3b6d01efaaa08347b15327/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L317)

Finally, [exportData()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/02f1e7f8c0f7d88b9e603daf7ddb0b6c55a8f237/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L1807-L1895) 
saves space_carve.pkl and call export to shdom.

[exportToShdom()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/c85e88bd0cf35bbd095744e2b2dc92600eb6e0c5/CameraNetwork/export.py#L51-L168): 
includes final masking of ROI and sunshader, and it saves the sun mask separately.
##### Questions regarding space carving:  
3. what is the difference between a mask that is saved to the space_carve.pkl?


#### Notes and questions regarding ROI:
1. In the class [image_analysis](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/994af1ad6f7d465ec5bff38d3ca22e338225e9fe/CameraNetwork/gui/image_analysis.py#L129-L228), 
there exist the following objects:
*"ROI"* object is based on [a generic region-of-interest widget](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation/graphicsItems/roi.html#pyqtgraph.ROI). 
The projected grid, *"grid_scatter"* is of [ScatterPlotItem](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation/graphicsItems/scatterplotitem.html#pyqtgraph.ScatterPlotItem).
The *"mask_ROI"* is of [pg.PolyLineROI](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation/graphicsItems/roi.html#pyqtgraph.PolyLineROI).
 What is the relation between ROI and ROI_mask? 
Which of the objects is being used in the final mask calculation of the image?

2. When [drawing the camera](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/c69dda2adc041dc2dc98660b34e57769213f23a9/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L266-L315) there is an option to add the drow of
 ["roi_mesh"](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/c69dda2adc041dc2dc98660b34e57769213f23a9/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L301-L310), the 3D projection of cameras' ROIs. 
 Currently, it is not visually clear and it seems that these objects are not perfectly calculated on the 2D ROIs. 
 It requires a farther investigation. E.g. how and when the 3D mesh is calculated?  
 Also, maybe we need to update the mesh visualization of ROI in 3D.  

3. ***TODO*** Find a way to calculate the ROI automatically based on the grid projection?  
### 2. Extrinsic calibration
This process is done according to sun position and sunshader. 
The process should apply for a sunny day having clear sky, and requires two steps:
1. [handle_sunshader_scan()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/4f6a0b01111725799e6796dbf206f624a99c231b/CameraNetwork/server.py#L1066-L1088) 

    - calculates sun position on the image plane (`measured_positions`), sun shader angle, the color value, and then save all to `sun_positions.csv`(under sun_positions folder). 

    - This process is done every ~6 min.
2. [handle_extrinsic()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/3552f2453f3d42942ae6f90c2245b9ccb7c3dbce/CameraNetwork/controller.py#L965-L1070) - 

    - loads `measured_positions` from `sun_positions.csv` 
and calculates the `measured_directions` according to the fisheye model (undistortion)
on a unit sphere. 

     - The fisheye model is pre-determined during [intrinsic calibration process](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/3552f2453f3d42942ae6f90c2245b9ccb7c3dbce/CameraNetwork/controller.py#L888-L901).
     
    - Using the measurements times in `sun_positions.csv` and *ephem*, the function calculates sun directions `calculated_directions`. 
And then estimates camera orientation, by doing fit of `measured_directions` to `calculated_directions`. 

    - This process gives as well the rotation matrix *R* (camera-to-world transform ).

To apply the extrinsic calibration from the GUI: 

  - `severs` ->
 `choose camera` -> `Exrinsic` tab -> 
 `extrinsic calibrate` 
  - Also saves the extrinsic_data.npy in camera folder.


To save all cameras extrinsic calibration: 

  - `Arrays` --> `Save Extrinsic`
 
  - Saves in a specific day of captured_images folder.

Graphical Result:

![extrinsic](docs/source/images/snapshot_extrinsic.png)

- See a mathematical description, see p.49-50 in Amit's thesis, section: "Self-Calibration in a Camera Network".

### 3. Radiometric calibration:
To perform radiometric calibration with a sunphotometer, 
the camera should be close to the sunphotometer, and the measurements should be done in a clear sky day. 

To get the sunphotometer measurements: 

1. Download files from NASA's [AERONET site](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/webtool_inv_v3?stage=3&region=Middle_East&state=Israel&site=Technion_Haifa_IL&place_code=10&if_polarized=0).

    - All the current files can be found under `.../data/aeronet`. 
  
    - Some manipulation, such as deleting first rows, might be needed for new data. 

    - The meaning of numbers and measurements can be found [here](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/units.html). 

    - Specifically: irradiance sunphotometer units are ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=uW/cm^2/sr/nm).

2. The function [handle_radiometric()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/3552f2453f3d42942ae6f90c2245b9ccb7c3dbce/CameraNetwork/controller.py#L1095-L1178):

    - reads the sunphotometer measurements according to 3 channels at the requested day and hour. 
    
    - Then estimates the location of the pixel on the image plane corresponding to Almucantar measurement angles. 
    
    - Then the radiometric fit is estimated between sunphotometer measurements to camera samples. 

3. The radiometric results are saved to radiometric.pkl under the camera's folder.

For example:

[Radiometric](docs/source/images/radiometric_calibration.png)


##### Questions regarding radiometric calibration:  
1. What are the final conversion units?
2. What inputs/changes are required for a new experiment?

### 4. 3D grid and space curving:
The [geographic coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) that are used here are: 
1. The ECEF (earth-centered, earth-fixed frame) is the common 3D grid that is being used for moving the point-of-view (the observing camera) around the grid conveniently according to cameras' location (Latitude (\phi), longitude (\lambda),X_ecef,Y_ecef,Z_ecef). 
2. The NED (North East Down) grid (X,Y,Z) is used for visualization and reconstruction grid.

See their definitions in the project [here](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/c69dda2adc041dc2dc98660b34e57769213f23a9/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L1393-L1420). 
image of the relation between both coordinates systems: 

![ECEF_ENU](docs/source/images/ECEF_ENU_Longitude_Latitude_relationships.png)
 
There are several conversion processes that are being done: 

1. [ProjectGrid()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/fa7d2b2f29d5217cdc2b216ae55d147393e9db0d/CameraNetwork/image_utils.py#L615-L645) - Projecting the 3D grid of the interest volume, onto image plane. Which uses ecef2ned in [projectECEF()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/c69dda2adc041dc2dc98660b34e57769213f23a9/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L881-L933). 
The 3D NED grid is of size 12 X 12 X 10 [km^3], having 81 X 81 X 121 voxels, each voxel size is of 150 X 150 X 100 [m^3].
The 3D grid is projected to a 2D grid on the image plane, shown as red dots on image plane).
This is done when choosing: `View settings`-->`Widgets`--> `show grid`. 


![roi_grid_los_and_settings](docs/source/images/roi_grid_los_and_settings.png)


This method is also being used when computing the [space carve](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/fa7d2b2f29d5217cdc2b216ae55d147393e9db0d/CameraNetwork/image_utils.py#L738-L810) score per each view.
This is done when choosing in the map view `Space carving`--> `Update` --> `Show space carving`.

![space_carving](docs/source/images/space_carving.png)

Another usage of this method is when applying [Update LOS](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/c69dda2adc041dc2dc98660b34e57769213f23a9/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L620-L667). Ths function converts the  also uses 
LOS of a single image to the epipolar lines on all other images.


![camera_array-los1](docs/source/images/camera_array.png)

To change the line of sight, simply press inside any one of the images. The others should update automatically.

![los2](docs/source/images/los2.png)

The change should also be visible in the map if `show LOS` has been enabled. 

The 3D grid and ROI can also be seen in the map.

![map_los_roi_grid](docs/source/images/map_los_roi_grid.png)


2. The main process [do_space_carving()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/c69dda2adc041dc2dc98660b34e57769213f23a9/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L317-L337) of the 3D grid, calls visual hall calculation, using a process pool. 
[calc_visual_hull()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/2583c47e52d937ba70c5d7f9293d970c0fcba428/CameraNetwork/image_utils.py#L655-L739) runs space carve per each view separately, and collects their results.   

(// TODOL add snapshot and explanation here.). 

[space_carve_view()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/fa7d2b2f29d5217cdc2b216ae55d147393e9db0d/CameraNetwork/image_utils.py#L739-L810), projects the the 3D grid onto the corresponding image plane. 
This process is done according to the number of perturbations chosen by the user. The final `grid_score` is the mean value throughout the perturbations, for the voxels that are seen from this view. 

// TODOL add snapshot and explanation here.). 

The `grid score` is based on the `cloud_weights`. This is done at [_update_cloud_weights()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/c69dda2adc041dc2dc98660b34e57769213f23a9/CameraNetwork/gui/main.py#L936-L985), on the 2D image plane (see section *Computation of cloud scores maps*, p.23, Amit's Aides thesis).


Following that, [calc_visual_hull()](https://github.com/Addalin/cameranetwork/blob/2583c47e52d937ba70c5d7f9293d970c0fcba428/CameraNetwork/image_utils.py#L655-L739), collects scores from all servers/ subprocesses. 

### TODO: Other issues to cover regarding image pipeline: 
1. Calculate pixels phase function.?
2. Intrinsic calibration.
